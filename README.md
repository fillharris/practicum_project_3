### Overview

This is the third project of the Software Engineer bootcamp from Practicum by Yandex. The project showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. The project was built from a design that was provided in Figma and can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/1zCYcflj6BJx5VqOvXU9nb/Sprint-3-From-Homeland-to-Homeland-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1). The focus of the project was to create a responsive website using media queries, flexbox, and grid while implementing the BEM methodology in naming and file structure.
